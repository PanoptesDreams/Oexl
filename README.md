# Introduction

Simply known as 'Argus' or â–² for short, the Operator Experience is the launchpad to get you where you need to be as fast as possible.

This is achieved by placing known applications and data into an appropriate directory within the hierarchy, making them more accessible through logical storage exploration.

An example of the hierarchy can be found in the Argus Software repository.
